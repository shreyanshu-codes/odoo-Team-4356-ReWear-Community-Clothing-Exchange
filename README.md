# ReWeave - Sustainable Fashion Exchange ♻️

ReWeave is a modern, community-driven web application designed to revolutionize sustainable fashion. By enabling users to swap pre-loved clothing, earn points, and refresh their wardrobes, ReWeave promotes eco-conscious consumption without compromising style. Built with a cutting-edge tech stack, ReWeave delivers a seamless, secure, and engaging experience for users while empowering administrators to maintain a high-quality platform.

## 🌟 Project Overview

ReWeave addresses the environmental impact of fast fashion by creating a platform where users can exchange pre-owned clothing. Instead of purchasing new garments, users can browse, list, and swap items, fostering a circular economy.

With AI-powered features, responsive design, and robust security, ReWeave is built to scale and inspire sustainable fashion choices.

**Key Objectives:**
- Reduce textile waste by promoting clothing swaps.
- Provide an intuitive and engaging user experience.
- Leverage AI to simplify listing processes.
