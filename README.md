# ReWeave - Sustainable Fashion Exchange ‚ôª



ReWeave is a modern, community-focused web application dedicated to promoting sustainable fashion. It provides a platform for users to swap pre-loved clothing, earn points, and refresh their style without impacting the planet. Built with a powerful, modern tech stack, ReWeave offers a seamless and engaging user experience.



## ‚ú® Core Features



- *Secure Authentication*: Robust and secure user signup and login system powered by Firebase Authentication.

- *Interactive Item Swapping*: Users can browse a marketplace of clothing, view detailed item pages, and propose swaps with other users.

- *AI-Powered Listings*: Simplify the process of listing an item. Upload an image, and our Genkit-powered AI will automatically generate a title, description, category, and tags.
